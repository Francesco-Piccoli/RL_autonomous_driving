# RL_autonomous_driving


In this project, we are interested in applying Reinforcement Learning techniques to minimize collision between vehicles in a scenario where we have an autonomous vehicle that is controlled by a policy and is interacting with other vehicles (autonomous or human-driven).

Our project is composed of different parts. We first conducted a literature review to better understand the state of the art in the field of reinforcement learning applied to autonomous driving. Subsequently, we chose an existing [Gym environment](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env) from the analyzed literature. Finally, we trained different agents on the new environment and compared their performances.
